# AP Digital Operations Manager

A full-stack **Accounts Payable automation platform** that streamlines invoice processing, PO matching, exception handling, and approval workflows — powered by AI intelligence via Claude.

## Architecture

```
frontend/          Next.js 15 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + React Query
backend/           FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + PostgreSQL
docker-compose.yml PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO (S3), Backend, Frontend
```

## Key Features

### Invoice Processing
- Upload and manage invoices with full lifecycle tracking (draft → extracted → matched → approved → posted)
- **AI-powered OCR extraction** via Claude Vision — extracts invoice numbers, dates, amounts, line items, and GL account predictions from PDFs/images
- Real-time confidence scoring based on extraction completeness

### PO Matching
- Two-way matching engine (invoice ↔ purchase order)
- Configurable tolerance thresholds
- Automatic exception creation for variances

### Exception Management
- 12 exception types (missing PO, amount variance, duplicate invoice, vendor on hold, etc.)
- **AI-powered exception analysis** — Claude suggests severity levels and resolution approaches
- Assignment, escalation, and resolution workflows with full comment threads

### Approval Workflows
- Configurable approval matrix with role-based routing
- **AI-powered approval recommendations** — Claude analyzes invoice risk considering match results, vendor history, and exception patterns
- Batch approval for high-volume processing

### AI Chat Assistant
- Slide-out chat panel with conversational AI
- Real-time access to system statistics (pending invoices, open exceptions, approval queues)
- AP domain expertise — workflow guidance, exception resolution advice, best practices

### Dashboard & Analytics
- Real-time KPI dashboard (match rates, processing times, straight-through rates)
- Invoice processing funnel visualization
- Trend analysis and top vendor performance

### Data Import
- Bulk import for purchase orders, goods receipts, and vendors via CSV/Excel
- Job tracking with progress and error reporting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local frontend dev)
- Python 3.12+ (for local backend dev)

### Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000/docs
# MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001
```

### Local Development

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
docker compose up -d postgres redis minio

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Seed demo data
python -m app.seed

# Start server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and configure:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection | `postgresql://ap_user:ap_password_dev@localhost:5432/ap_operations` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key | (change in production) |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key | (empty = AI features disabled) |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Claude model ID | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | MinIO/S3 endpoint | `http://localhost:9000` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |

> AI features gracefully degrade when `LLM_API_KEY` is not set — the app works fully with rule-based fallbacks.

## User Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| `ap_clerk` | Upload invoices, view exceptions, import data |
| `ap_analyst` | Manage exceptions, run matching, view analytics |
| `approver` | Approve/reject invoices, view approval queue |
| `admin` | Full access including user and vendor management |
| `auditor` | Read-only access to all data and audit trails |
